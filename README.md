## About me
I have recently completed my master's in the field of Applied Computer Sciences with a major in Embedded Development. Curiosity and willingness to embrace new challenges have facilitated my growth in multiple domains and I am looking for an opportunity that continues to push me through such new challenges. Analysing logical problems and finding efficient solutions on HackerRank has been one of my hobbies for quite some time. Recently developed my interest in working with Embedded Development and am eager to explore the potential of an FPGA Board.
